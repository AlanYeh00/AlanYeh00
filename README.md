### About Me  
Hi, my name is Sung Yu, but you can just call me Alan. I’m an international student from Taiwan and recently graduated from Loyola University Chicago with a degree in Computer Science. Before switching to CS, I majored in Mechanical Engineering in Taiwan, which gives me a unique perspective when tackling technical challenges. Currently, I’m on the lookout for internship opportunities across the U.S. and am excited to dive into new fields and learn as much as I can.  

I’ve learned with:  
- Programming languages: Java, Python, and a bit of C++.  
- Tools and technologies: PLC programming, AutoCAD, SolidWorks, CREO, Wireshark traffic analysis, IDS/IPS (Snort Signatures), Distributed Memory Parallelism with OpenMPI, and Parallel N-body problem with OpenMP.

### My Aspirations

I’m ready to step out of my comfort zone, adapt to new environments, and keep learning. My goal is to become a valuable, trustworthy person who can contribute meaningfully to society and make life a little better for everyone.
